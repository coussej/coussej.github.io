Hi, I'm Jeroen Coussement, a software engineer living in Belgium. My work resolves around industrial software: MES systems, Machine interfacing, Business Intelligence, ... Aside from that I'm a heavy supporter of open-source technologies as in many cases they are both technology-wise and community-wise superior to their closed-source competitors.
